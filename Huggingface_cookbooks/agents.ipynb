    "# Build an agent with tool-calling superpowers 🦸 using Transformers Agents\n",
    "_Authored by: [Aymeric Roucher](https://huggingface.co/m-ric)_\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can use [**Transformers Agents**](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/agents) to build awesome **agents**!\n",
    "\n",
    "What are **agents**? Agents are systems that are powered by an LLM and enable the LLM (with careful prompting and output parsing) to use specific *tools* to solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These *tools* are basically functions that the LLM couldn't perform well by itself: for instance for a text-generation LLM like [Llama-3-70B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct), this could be an image generation tool, a web search tool, a calculator...\n",
    "\n",
    "What is **Transformers Agents**? it's an extension of our `transformers` library that provides building blocks to build your own agents! Learn more about it in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/agents).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to use it, and which use cases it can solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "We install transformers agents from source since it has not been released as of writing, but later this week when it gets release you can simply install it with `pip install transformers[agents]`."

    "## 2. 📚💬 RAG with Iterative query refinement & Source selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick definition: Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) is ___“using an LLM to answer a user query, but basing the answer on information retrieved from a knowledge base”.___\n",
    "\n",
    "This method has many advantages over using a vanilla or fine-tuned LLM: to name a few, it allows to ground the answer on true facts and reduce confabulations, it allows to provide the LLM with domain-specific knowledge, and it allows fine-grained control of access to information from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now let’s say we want to perform RAG, but with the additional constraint that some parameters must be dynamically generated. For example, depending on the user query we could want to restrict the search to specific subsets of the knowledge base, or we could want to adjust the number of documents retrieved. The difficulty is: **how to dynamically adjust these parameters based on the user query?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A frequent failure case of RAG is when the retrieval based on the user query does not return any relevant supporting documents. **Is there a way to iterate by re-calling the retriever with a modified query in case the previous results were not relevant?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🔧 Well, we can solve the points above in a simple way: we will **give our agent control over the retriever's parameters!**\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ Let's show how to do this. We first load a knowledge base on which we want to perform RAG: this dataset is a compilation of the documentation pages for many `huggingface` packages, stored as markdown.\n"
